Youtube Project 1

Using jquery and the youtube API, make a playlist application. This should be a single page application that lets a user search for youtube videos, save them to a play list, and then watch those videos. Basic playlist management should be included (add,delete, reorganize).
Search results should display the first twenty results from youtube, and have a button to save that result to your playlist.
 
Requirements
1) Search box to search for videos - returns a list of videos
2) When user clicks on the "send to playlist" button on a video in the search list, it is sent to the playlist
3) When user clicks on a playlist video, it will play within the page.
4) Playlist entries should have a "delete" button that removes them from the playlist.
